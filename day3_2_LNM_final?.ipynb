It's overall implementation is shown in the diagram below, which also serves as an outline of the steps you'll follow to implement the model in a simulation.  "

    "Before we begin, it is important to state that it is easier if we work with discrete time units, i.e., with time bins of equal size. Let's take care of that now and define a time bin dt of 1 ms. We can set dt to 1 (ms) or 0.001 (s).\n",

    "# **1) Stimulus** \n",
    "\n",
    "If you remember, the contrast values or the pattern sequences that make up the stimuli we use are determined by drawing numbers randomly from a distribution. For the simulation, a sequence of random numbers suffices as stimulus.  First, we need to decide how long our stimulus will be. We should have a long enough stimulus so that we can calculate meaningful statistics with it, but not too long that calculations are lengthy and take too much time.\n",

    "Our stimulus will be generated by choosing numbers randomly from a normal distribution with mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. Look for a numpy function that gives you normally distributed numbers.\n",

    "# **2) Linear Filter**\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear filter determines what your neuron is \"interested\" in **in the temporal domain**. In very general terms, filtering means letting through what is wanted while letting out what is not. The more similar a signal is to a neuron's filter, the higher the chance it will go through and be picked up by it; the more the signal differs from the filter, the likelier it will be ignored.  How large is a filter? It depends on the memory of the neuron, i.e., how farther in the past can a signal bear influence on spiking in the present. For retinal cells, a filter extending to 600 ms before the spike is typically long enough to capture everything, with most of the interesting things happening between 0 and 200 ms before the spike. To give you an idea, it might look something like this:"

    "\n",
    "To implement the filtering in the simulation we should somehow \"pass\" the entire signal through the filter. The mathematical operation we use for this is called *convolution*. What it does is, it \"slides\" the filter along the signal making a point-to-point multiplication at each step: similarities will produce larger positive values, whereas discrepancies will produce smaller or negative values. The result of this operation is a vector called the *generator signal* that stores all the products of said multiplications. The generator signal should have the same length as your stimulus.\n",

Keep in mind that neurons cannot have a negative firing rate, so the output of the nonlinear transformation should always be positive.\n",
